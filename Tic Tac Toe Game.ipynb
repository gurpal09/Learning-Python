    "In 3 previous exercises, we built up a few components needed to build a Tic Tac Toe game in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Draw the Tic Tac Toe game board\n",
    "Checking whether a game board has a winner\n",
    "Handle a player move from user input\n",
    "The next step is to put all these three components together to make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game! Your challenge in this exercise is to use the functions from those previous exercises all together in the same program to make a two-player game that you can play with a friend. There are a lot of choices you will have to make when completing this exercise, so you can go as far or as little as you want with it.\n",

    "Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should keep track of who won - if there is a winner, show a congratulatory message on the screen.\n",
    "If there are no more moves left, don’t ask for the next player’s move!\n",
    "As a bonus, you can ask the players if they want to play again and keep a running tally of who won more - Player 1 or Player 2."
